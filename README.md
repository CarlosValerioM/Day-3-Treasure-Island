## Description:  
`treasureIsland.py` is a simple text-based adventure game where the player makes choices to navigate an island in search of hidden treasure. At each step, the player is presented with multiple options, and selecting the wrong one results in death, while the correct choices lead further into the adventure until the treasure is found.  

## Usage:  

1. Clone this repository:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CarlosValerioM/Day-3-Treasure-Island.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Day-3-Treasure-Island
```
Run the script:
```bash
python treasureIsland.py
```
Follow the prompts and make your choices wisely to find the treasure!

## Example Output:
You are at a crossroad. Where do you want to go? Left or Right: left

You come to a lake. Do you swim or wait for a boat? wait

You reach an island with three doors. Which one do you choose? Red, Blue, or Yellow: yellow

Congratulations! You found the treasure!

## How it works:
The player starts at a crossroad and must choose to go left or right.

Depending on their choice, they may continue the adventure or face an untimely end.

If they choose correctly, they reach a lake where they must decide whether to swim or wait.

Choosing to wait leads to an island with three doorsâ€”one of which contains the treasure.

Selecting the correct door results in victory, while the others lead to different dangers.
